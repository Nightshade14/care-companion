# Care Companion: Comprehensive AI-Powered Medical Imaging and Patient Care Solution

## Value Proposition
The  Care Companion system will be seamlessly integrated into existing healthcare practices, providing doctors with enhanced diagnostic tools. In traditional healthcare systems, radiologists face challenges analyzing numerous X-rays and CT scans, leading to delays, burnout, and missed diagnoses. By incorporating AI-powered image analysis, doctors can quickly identify fractures from X-rays, and detect signs of pneumonia and tuberculosis in chest X-rays, improving diagnostic accuracy. This AI-powered system will save time for healthcare professionals, enabling them to focus on patient care. It will enhance workflow in hospitals, clinics, and radiology centers, allowing healthcare providers to deliver faster, more reliable results with Real-time predictions and continuous feedback. 

The system's success will be evaluated based on its ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce operational costs, and improve patient satisfaction. However, in medical AI, where human lives are at stake, performance metrics prioritize patient safety over raw accuracy. While precision and AUC-ROC are tracked, we focus on optimizing the model for high recall (sensitivity) to minimize false negativesâ€”ensuring no critical fracture, pneumonia, or TB case goes undetected, even at the cost of more false positives. This aligns with clinical best practices, where follow-up tests for potential false alarms are preferable to missed diagnoses. By balancing recall with clinician trust, we reduce liability risks while enabling early interventions that cut long-term costs.

While the AI-powered detection system enhances diagnostic accuracy, it should not be solely relied upon for final decisions. The predictions made by the system are assistance tools, and healthcare professionals should always validate the results through their expertise and further testing. We also employ a warning system that provides the confidence for each prediction made while also alerting the radiologist  that the predictions made can be incorrect and needs a thorough review before finalizing the report. Additionally, we create a dashboard that allows the technicians to monitor the data drift for any potential flaws in the system.
